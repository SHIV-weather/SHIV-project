# SHIV-project
An open-source application built with Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), known as the Storm and Hurricane Interactive Visualizer (SHIV). Our main goal is to provide an ‘interactive and extensible environment for authoring visualizations,’ to a wide spectrum of users - from researchers and meteorologists to casual weather observers. Through SHIV, users will be able to access, author, and export customizable weather data visualizations.

# Why make this tool?
The atmospheric science community often relies on visualization of observed data for routine analysis and weather prediction. For example, the intensity of hurricanes is estimated by observing specific cloud patterns in satellite images, a method known as the Dvorak Technique. Visual cues and multiplatform datasets are essential to estimate the severity of many storms, especially tropical cyclones (the general term for hurricanes, typhoons and large cyclones). These cues and datasets are also vital to understanding the physical processes that underlie the genesis, intensification, and tracks of these storms. Visualizing 3D and 2D images in combined datasets in an interactive manner is crucial to improve the identification of such processes and patterns. The visualization and comprehension of storms also greatly benefits from the addition of other datasets, such as lightning, wind fields, and meteorological model outputs. As the current hurricane season has been predicted to be above-normal (https://whyy.org/articles/noaa-predicts-above-normal-atlantic-hurricane-season-stresses-it-only-takes-one/), there has been an increased concern and, consequently, interest in interactive visualization tools. 

# Team
**Dr. Natalia N. Solorzano**: Prof. Solorzano’s areas of expertise are atmospheric electricity, remote sensing, meteorology, and physics simulation, particularly real-time collision detection. She is a Research Scientist at NorthWest Research Associates (NWRA), and an Associate Professor of Physics at DigiPen Institute of Technology. Since August 2011, she has been developing tools for integrating lightning and radiometer data and authored the Eos article regarding WWLLN-TC. Solorzano will be the overall project lead overseeing the atmospheric science data sets, data visualization, and simulation, and she will supervise students from DigiPen or University of Washington. 

**Dr. Jeremy N. Thomas**: Prof. Thomas’ areas of expertise are atmospheric and space electricity. He is a Research Scientist at NorthWest Research Associates (NWRA) and an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at DigiPen Institute of Technology; both of which are located in Redmond, WA.  Thomas will be the lead for acquiring, organizing, and integrated atmosphere science data sets, and he will supervise students from DigiPen or University of Washington. 

**Dr. Pushpak Karnick**: Prof. Karnick’s areas of expertise are procedural and geo-spatial visualization. He is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at DigiPen Institute of Technology, Redmond WA. His previous projects include the development of a Shape Grammar for geospatial visualization, and procedural modeling in a Minecraft world. Karnick will be the lead for visualization and graphics implementation, and he will supervise students from DigiPen.

**Sam Hardin**: Finishing his BS in Computer Science from DigiPen Institute of Technology (Fall 2020 completion), his focus has been on programming, real-time interactions, and mathematics. His role will be to help develop the backend of the project as well as be a consultant on Unreal's APIs for other teammates.

**Matthew Gilbert**: Matthew's areas of expertise are programming, game engines, and machine learning. He is a 2019 graduate from the BS in Computer Science program at DigiPen Institute of Technology. He is currently pursuing his MS in Computer Science at DigiPen (Fall 2020 completion) with a focus on image processing and machine learning.
