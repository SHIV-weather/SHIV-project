# SHIV-project
An open source project to provide an interactive visualization of hurricanes, cyclones, and tropical storms. This tool is in development with the intended audience ranging from meteorologists to simply intrigued people. Given the ability to see subsections of satellite data, superimpose them on top of each other, and run filters to clean the data, this tool can be leveraged to ease the job of reading weather patterns and forecasts.

# Why make this tool?
The atmospheric science community often relies on visualization of observed data for routine analysis and weather prediction. For example, the intensity of hurricanes is estimated by observing specific cloud patterns in satellite images, a method known as the Dvorak Technique. Visual cues and multiplatform datasets are essential to estimate severity of many storms, especially tropical cyclones (the general term for hurricanes and tropical storms globally), as well as to understand the physical processes that underlie their genesis, intensification, and tracks. Visualizing 3D and 2D images in combined datasets in an interactive manner is crucial to improve the identification of such processes and patterns. The visualization and comprehension of storms also greatly benefits from the addition of other datasets, such as lightning, wind fields, and meteorological model outputs. As the current hurricane season has been predicted to be above-normal (https://whyy.org/articles/noaa-predicts-above-normal-atlantic-hurricane-season-stresses-it-only-takes-one/), there has been an increased concern and, consequently, interest in interactive visualization tools. 

# Team
**Dr. Natalia N. Solorzano**: Prof. Solorzano’s areas of expertise are atmospheric electricity, remote sensing, meteorology, and physics simulation, particularly real-time collision detection. She is a Research Scientist at NorthWest Research Associates (NWRA), and she is an Associate Professor of Physics at DigiPen Institute of Technology. Since August 2011, she has been developing tools for integrating lightning and radiometer data and authored the Eos article regarding WWLLN-TC.  Solorzano will be the overall project lead overseeing the atmospheric science data sets, data visualization, and simulation, and she will supervise students from DigiPen Institute of Technology or University of Washington. 

**Dr. Jeremy N. Thomas**: Prof. Thomas’s areas of expertise are atmospheric and space electricity. He is a Research Scientist at NorthWest Research Associates (NWRA) and an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at DigiPen Institute of Technology; both of which are located in Redmond, WA.  Thomas will be the lead for acquiring, organizing, and integrated atmosphere science data sets, and he will supervise students from DigiPen Institute of Technology or University of Washington. 

**Dr. Pushpak Karnick**: Prof. Karnick’s areas of expertise are procedural and geo-spatial visualization. He is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at DigiPen Institute of Technology, Redmond WA. His previous projects include the development of a Shape Grammar for geospatial visualization [Karnick et al. 2009], and procedural modeling in a Minecraft world [Karnick et al. 2013]. Karnick will be the lead for visualization and graphics implementation, and he will supervise students from DigiPen Institute of Technology.

**Sam Hardin**: Finishing his undergraduate degree in Computer Science from DigiPen Institute of Technology, his focus has been on programming, real-time interactions, and mathematics. His role will be to help develop the backend of the project as well as be a consultant on Unreal's APIs for other teammates.

**Matthew Gilbert**: Matthew's areas of expertise are programming, game engines, and machine learning. He is a recent graduate from the undergraduate Computer Science program at DigiPen Institute of Technology in Redmond, Washington. He is currently pursuing his graduate degree with a focus on image processing and machine learning, with a planned graduation date of December, 2020.
